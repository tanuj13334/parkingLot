# parkingLot
Design a parking lot using Python

# Description

This repository gives an overview of how we can design a basic parking lot in Python. It creates parking lot with given number of slots.

parking_lot.py script defines the following functions -

"create_parking_lot n" - Given n number of slots, create a parking lot
"park" - park a given car in next empty slot with registration number and driver's age.
leave x - Removes vehicle from slot number x
There are few query functions to retrieve slot number from registration number of car, get registration numbers of cars from driver age etc.


parking_lot.py can be run through file containing test cases. An example python parking_lot.py -f sample_input_TCs
Vehicle.py is a separate class where we can define the type of vehicles that can be parked. As of now, it only contains class Car
